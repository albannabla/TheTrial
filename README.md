# The Trial

HUMANITY has been emiting such drab vibes into the aether that the COURT OF GALACTIC OPINION is considering whether Humanity should be *CANCELLED*. The COURT has sent an ADJUDICATOR to Earth who is calling on SHERIN for her expert testimony (oh shit!). 

Whether Sherin saves us... or drops the guillotine! all depends on the evidence she gathers from us!

All the players in the narrative represent artefacts from Earth that Sherin will be able to interact with and collect evidence from.
