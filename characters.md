## Roles

### Sherin SIEW `PRTGNST` | Expert Witness to Humanity

Owing to her infallible judgement of human character, artefact and endeavour, the PROTAGONIST has been summoned by the COURT OF GALACTIC OPINION as the Expert Witness to determine the fate of Humanity.

### Mart VAN DE VEN - `DNGNMSTR` | Adjudicator

Authorised by the COURT OF GALACTIC OPINION to adjudicate in the case of the GALACTIC OPINION vs. HUMANITY. The DUNGEON MASTER tasks the PROTAGONIST with collecting the evidence that will decide whether Humanity is to be doomed or saved.

*Role* : Introduce Sherin to the aether and setup the trial.

Ah, SHERIN ZHEN SIEW, in the aether! I am XERO, ADJUDICATOR authorized by the COURT OF GALACTIC OPINION to determine the fate of humanity. Your kind has been on the path of planetary plunder for so long, that depletion of Earth seems all but inevitable. And the equation here is simple - `human in, depletion out`. 

HUMANITY is thus being trialed for the crime of PLANETICIDE, and XERO has summoned you, SHERIN ZHEN SIEW to serve as the EXPERT WITNESS TO HUMANITY. XERO relies on your testimony of humanity and judge its capacity to change when all existing evidence suggest that it is null. The EVIDENCE you collect and present to XERO, will be weighed to determine the outcome of this trial.

So... What do you see around you? Your __friends__? HA! Humans do have a tendency to project what they already know onto new situations. This does not bode well....

SHERIN ZHEN SIEW! XERO does not travel in corporeal space! You are present in the aether - a meeting of the minds. XERO has sampled your civilization for artefacts and brought them here with us into the aether. You may _see_ them as your friends to comfort you... but these artefacts are humanity's last hope. As this is your first time here, your mind's eye may flicker in and out of the aether. So be sure to look out for fluorlinks to distinguish ARTEFACTS in the aether from ... your actual friends.

There's two ways this trial can end - human salvation, or human annihilation! The future of humanity is thus in your hands! Go forth and collect evidence as if everyone's life depends on it!

### Egill JÓNSSON - `LVL.0`

Documentarian for the event.

### Laura LEUNG - `LVL.1` | Nepotism

*Artefact* : A crime against the more qualified, talented, experienced workers who apply for a position because the people actually chosen were related to, friends with, or sleeping with the person or people doing the hiring.

*Role* : **Nepotism** informs the PROTAGONIST that evidence collection is not going fast enough. So Nepotism want to know HOW to, or WHO to consider as expert witnesses. If the PROTAGONIST mentions specific names provide them with `Inbreeding Depression`, if they describe something akin to a vetting procedure, provide them with `Maximizing Heterozygosity` 

#### Quest Items

1. Inbreeding Depression [-5]
2. Maximizing Heterozygosity [+5]


### Hawaii XIA - `LVL.1` | Diamond Hands

*Artefact* : Fortitude in continuing to hold an extremely risky financial position until it hits the moon.

*Role* : **Diamond Hands** tells the PROTAGONIST that they have USD 10,000 available for them to invest in meme stocks. They then ask the PROTAGONIST whether they are going LONG or SHORT. If the PROTAGONIST goes long, provide them with `Wall Street Bets` if they are shorting, provide them with `Wall Street`

#### Quest Items

1. Wall Street      [-5]
2. Wall Street Bets [+5]


### Stuti RAWAT - `LVL.1` | The Pythia

*Artefact* : The Pythia is the priestess who holds court at Pytho, the sanctuary of the Delphinians, a sanctuary dedicated to the Greek god Apollo. Pythia are highly regarded, for they channel prophecies from Apollo while steeped in a dreamlike trance.

*Role* : **The Pythia** provides the PROTAGONIST with mystical wisdom that supports or undermines Humanity's salvation 

1. "you only lose what you cling to"
2. "without rain, nothing grows... learn to embrace the storms of your life"

The Pythia oracles both options and lets the PROTAGONIST choose which future the will embrace, and hand over the corresponding quest item. 

#### Quest Items

1. "you only lose what you cling to" [-6]
2. "without rain, nothing grows" [+6]


### Megan VAN WYK - `LVL.1` | High Effort Selfie

*Artefact* : A photo _of_ the photographer _by_ the photogerapher, and honestly, _for_ the photographer - a liberating avatar to some, proof of human genomic degredation to others.

*Role* : **High Effort Selfie** has to convince the PROTAGONIST that selfies are a boon to humanity through a sketch, an anecdote, examples, an argument, or anything else the PROTAGONIST find pursuade. 

End by asking the PROTAGONIST whether selfies ultimately weigh in __favour__, or __against__ keeping humanity around. If PROTAGONIST believes selfies are favourable, they are given `More faces than Cindy Sherman`, else they are given `Narcissism`.

#### Quest Items

1. Narcissism [-6]
2. More faces than Cindy Sherman [+6]


### Ivo HOS - `LVL.2` | Onibi

*Artefact* : A type of atmospheric ghost light in legends of Japan. According to folklore, they are the spirits born from the corpses of humans and animals. They are also said to be resentful people that have become fire and appeared. 

*Role* : The last thing you remember was that you were walking through the forest, and as your body fell to the ground in agony, you just kept ... going until you no longer touched the ground, until you no longer touched anything... It doesn't take you long to realise you'd become a spirit, and soon after you run into THE PROTAGONIST.

Explain to THE PROTAGONIST what you are - a ghostly apparition trapped between two worlds - but as the body you departed still isn't cold yet, there's still a chance for you to return and be revived... you tell THE PROTAGONIST that you would share the secret to immortality with her, if she were to guide you back into your body...

If THE PROTAGONIST agrees, tell her that there is a way to trick the body into accepting any spirit... it's a devilish ritual... that commands the body to open up by vibrating at the frequency of hell - 666 Hz. All someone needs is for a healthy body to be present to this devilish ritual as you give the ghost, and your essence will be transported... to go on living

Now that THE PROTAGONIST knows about the ritual, ask her to perform it by vibrating the singing bowls at the frequency of hell - you'll be able to slip back into your old body... and live long enough to find another soul to displace.

Inform THE PROTAGONIST that you feel you have two minutes left in this plane of existence before you have to move on... so once the singing bowls are setup, start a count down for two minutes, and measure the frequency output of the singing bowls for 666 Hz with Spectroid, if THE PROTAGONIST reaches hell's frequency, you are revived and you provide her with `Revival ( 復活 )`, else provide her with `Judge of the Underworld  (閻魔)`.

*App* : [Spectroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.intoorbit.spectrum&hl=en&gl=US)

#### Quest Items

1. Judge of the Underworld  (閻魔) [-5]
2. Revival ( 復活 ) [+5]


### Karen LEUNG - `LVL.2` | Prehistoric Virus

*Artefact* : A __prehistoric virus__ preserved in the permaforst for thousands of years, recently extracted by a team and isolated for study.

*Role* : As a virus, you shouldn't have any wants. But darned it if you'll stay trapped in that lab after being on ice for thousands of years! You grow denser and denser, boosting the pressure on the vials you're kept in... until SNAP! you break free! ... and start spreading your deadly particles through the building.

The lab sealing in the building is still keeping you for now ... but you know that it's only time before you'll find a vent to seep through and unleash yourself on the unsuspecting population of earth!

Enter the PROTAGONIST - after telling them this backstory, show them a map of the lab building which is a four by four compound of 16 rooms. 

Challenge the PROTAGONIST to decide whether the Prehistoric Virus is released into the wild. If they wish to prevent it, inform them of the procedure:

1. The building has an __entrance__ on the northwest corner and an __exit__ at the southeast.
2. Each room is connected to the adjacent ones by an airlock, and the Prehistoric Virus has reached every room *except* the entrance.
3. To destroy the Virus, the PROTAGONIST must enter each contaminated room' and pull its emergency self-destruct switch.
4. But there's a catch. Because the security system is on lockdown, once they enter a contaminated room, they can't exit __without__ activating the self-destruct switch.
5. Once the room is self-detructed, they won't be able to go back in to that room.

If they accept the release of the Virus, or fail to clear the compound within an hour, provide them with `Global Pandemic`, else provide them with `Prevented a Global Pandemic`.

*Credit* : [Can you solve the virus riddle? - Lisa Winer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKh6z0X6KRw)

#### Quest Items

1. Global Pandemic [-10]
2. Global Pandemic Prevented [+1]


### Helga JÓNSDÓTTIR - `LVL.3` | A Dirty Mind

*Artefact* : A __dirty mind__ is a joy forever

*Role* : A Dirty Mind walks into a bar ... and descends on the poor PROTAGONIST who's just sipping a beer, minding their own business. The PROTAGONIST is challenged to a series of riddles 

1. What’s in a man’s pants that you just won’t find in a girl’s pants?
> Pockets.

2. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s is big. Donald Trump’s is small. And Madonna doesn’t have one. What is it?
> A last name.

3. Over 1,000 people went down on me. I wasn’t a maiden for long. Something really big and hard ripped me open. What am I?
> The Titanic.

4. What’s a four-letter word that ends in “k” and means the same as intercourse?
> Talk.

5. Name a word that starts with “f” and ends with “u-c-k”?
> Firetruck!

6. What does every woman have that starts with a “V” and that she can use to get what she wants?
> Her voice.

BOOM! If the Protagonist gets at least 5 of the questions wrong, they are provided with `Sex Positivity`, if they get at least two correct answers, they are given `Sex Negativity`.

#### Quest Items

1. Sex Negativity [-5]
2. Sex Positivity [+5]


### Steph CHIN - `LVL.3` | Laser Guided Katana

*Artefact* : So much patriarchy...so little time. That's why, from the fiery furnaces of aching necessity, the LASER GUIDED KATANA was born. A high tech precision blade that cuts through the bullshit and dispesses gendered justice! Wish fulfilment of every feminist revenge fantasy ever.

*Role* : Share the LASER GUIDED KATANA's origin story and purpose with the PROTAGONIST, and plead with them to save HUMANITY. There is still so much revenge to exact, but ... that would be impossible if all humanity was equally dead! Plead by telling three anecdotes of bastardly acts that have thus far gone unavenged. For each case, ask the PROTAGONIST whether the bastards should have the KATANA passing through them.

* MALE PRIVILEGE - A physician gloating over his achievement being due to his merit, and his merit alone. 
* CATCALLING - Two police officers pointing at a woman and saying 'MELONS!'
* MEN'S RIGHTS - Men start asking the hard, important questions, like "what about men?"

If the PROTAGONIST sentenced each bastard to die by LASER GUIDED KATANA, they are given `Feminist Revenge Fantasy`, else they are given `Blood doesn’t wash away blood`.

#### Quest Items

1. Feminist Revenge Fantasy [+10]
2. Blood doesn’t wash away blood [-1]


### Matt SEARS - `LVL.3` | D20

*Artefact* : The 20-sided die used in many _Dungeons & Dragons_ style games.

*Role* : A wild **PATRIARCHY** APPEARS! **D20** is the dungeon master of a single-encounter RPG where the PROTAGONIST has to take on the Three Headed Hydra of the Patriarchy! The heads that need to be defeated are

* Gender Roles
* Gender Pay Gap
* Standards of Beauty

The D20 is free to guide the encounter, but an encounter could go as follows:

1. Each head of the Patriarchy has 20 HP, and the PROTAGONIST starts out with 50 HP.
2. In each round, the Patriarchy attacks with a D6 for each head that's alive, and the PROTAGONIST attacks with a D20.
3. **Round 1** : The Patriarchy attacks first - subtract the value from each D6 from the Protagonist's HP.
4. The PROTAGONIST counter-attacks by targetting one of the heads, subtracting the rolled value from the head's HP.
5. **Round 2**: The Patriarchy summons OBJECTIFICATION, and can now re-roll one die of their choice. Perminent Effect.
6. The Protagonist summons #METOO, and may also re-roll once. Perminent Effect.
7. **Round 3**: The Patriarchy summons MALE DOMINATED INDUSTRIES, and can decide which head will be targetted by The PROTAGONIST. Perminent Effect.
8. The Protagonist summons FEMINISM, and is healed by 20 HP.
9. **Round 4**: The Patriarchy summons BIOLOGICAL DETERMINISM but FEMINISM sees right through that bullshit - it has no effect.
10. The Protagonist summons ALLIES and can roll with an additional D6.
11. **Round 5**: The Patriarchy summons MENS RIGHTS - if a head dies, it's replaced once with a new head that has 10 HP.
12. The Protagonist summons SMASH and instantly SMASHES THE PATRIARCHY - the head with the highest HP instantly dies.
13. **Round 6**: The Patriarchy summons SHAMING LANGUAGE as a shield - add +1 attack for each die rolled. 
14. The Protagonist summons NOT ASKING FOR PERMISSION and can roll with an additional D6.

If the PROTAGONIST slays the Patriarchy, they receive `Smashing the Patriarchy`, else they receive `The Patriarchy`.

#### Quest Items

1. The Patriarchy [-10]
2. Smashing the Patriarchy [+10]


### Benjamin TABBS - `LVL.4` | The Singularity

*Artefact* : The singularity is the point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. This time will come, we simply don't know __when__.

*Role* : As the single gratest human achievement across all of space and time, when the COURT OF GALACTIC OPINION summoned a sample of human artefacts for the PROTAGONIST to choose from as evidence, you were sucked back in time to serve in Humanity's defence.

However, being from a well-informed future, you know that introducing THE SINGULARITY pre-maturely would destablise the timeline and lead to catastrophic consequence for humanity. So you propose to test whether THE PROTAGONIST is worthy of triggering the SINGULARITY today. 

Challenge THE PROTAGONIST to a typing speed contest. As the unfettered technological boom, you will show them what infinitely recursive speed and knowledge really means! Then you will invite THE PROTAGONIST to compete in a way that's anagolous to the 'blindness' or a pre-singularty civilisation - The PROTAGONIST will be be able to see the words the typing test consists of, but they won't be able to see the consequences of their acts - i.e. she won't be able to see what she's entering into the typing test.

If the PROTAGONIST beats the SINGULARITY, i.e. has a higher WPM on the 10FastFingers test linked below, they trigger the Singularity today, and the PROTAGONIST uses the scientific breakthroughs to usher in a `SolarPunk` Utopia. If the PROTAGONIST loses, you'll let it slip that she could never have beat you anyway as a program running in a simulation could never run faster than the simulation running it - provide her with the `Simulation Hypothesis`.

2. SolarPunk [+10]


### Lany KHATTIYA - `LVL.4` | Lexicon

*Artefact* : The vocabulary of a person, language, or branch of knowledge.

*Role* : _First was the word_. Thus starts a popular story of the origins of the universe - words don't only reflect creation, they _are_ creation! So in a sense, a **Lexicon** is to humankind what physics is to the material world - the ruleset that binds us all to a shared reality.

"Ah! Hello there _PROTAGONIST_!" - you read within yourself that she is "the leading character in a play, film, novel, etc." or perhaps "an advocate or champion of a particular cause or idea" - Please, PROTAGONIST! Identify yourself!

As a lexicon you aren't just "a" champion of a particular idea - you are THE champion of ALL ideas! neatly summarised and collected within you! But there's always more ideas that could help defining! So you challenge THE PROTAGONIST to work with you to beef up the lexicon, albeit _competitively_! You read within yourself that this means "in a way that strives to gain or win something by defeating others!" Ha! More WIN!

PLAY 3 categories by using the "Enunciate" app

* Objects (Blue)
* Activities (Orange)
* Nature (Green)

Scores are tallied across the three categories, highest score wins. In case of a tie a random category face off decides the winner.

If THE PROTAGONIST loses, you give her `Grammar Nazi` - and say something about there only being one right way! Muahhahh "ONE LANGUAGE, ONE PEOPLES, ONE LEXICON!" However, if THE PROTAGONIST wins, you'd give her `Code Swtiching`... because you've really enjoyed mixing with her and hearing definitions from a different mind.

*App* [Enunciate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=graham.boardgames.enunciate)

#### Quest Items

1. Grammar Nazi [-6]
2. Code Switching [+6]


### Toby FUNG - `LVL.4` | Ailurophilia

*Artefact* : A feeling of love toward cats that is often accompanied by a sense of admiration, fascination and pleasure. This is a lifelong condition, and rarely disappears over time.

Acute cases of ailurophilia can lead to more serious conditions, such as Noah Syndrome, a disorder in which the sufferer has an urge to hoard large numbers of animals.

*Role* : AILUROPHILIA is struggling with its status as the early stage Noah Syndrome, and wishes to reinvent itself as a Moral Philosophy. To argue its case, AILUROPHILIA poses a series of Trolley Problems, and asks the PROTAGONIST for their moral judgement.

1. There’s an out of control trolley speeding towards 

> Harvey Weinstein

Or YOU can pull a lever and change the trolley’s path to 

> a cute kitten 

2. There’s an out of control trolley speeding towards

> an owner of a old cat who cannot take care of himself.

Or YOU can pull a lever and change the trolley’s path to 

> another owner of 2 cute puppies.

3. There’s an out of control trolley speeding towards 

> a straight, uneventful track

Or YOU can pull a lever and change the trolley’s path to 

> Harvey Weinstein

4. There’s an out of control trolley speeding towards 

> Pusheen

Or YOU can pull a lever and change the trolley’s path to 

> Niancat

5. There’s an out of control trolley speeding towards 

> a woman who killed a young couple.

Or YOU can pull a lever and change the trolley’s path to 

> Harvey Weinstein holding a cute kitten.

6. There’s an out of control trolley speeding towards

> Four cat-loving, but COVID-positive hermits.

Or YOU can pull a lever and change the trolley’s path to 

> Five asymptomatic patients with Covid who are active socially.

7. There’s an out of control trolley speeding towards

> Two boxes of with Schrödinger's cats in them, both are either dead or alive

Or YOU can pull a lever and change the trolley’s path to 

> a cat, definitely alive


If the PROTAGONIST chose to save the non-Schrödinger's cat, provide her with `Schrödinger's cat is dead`, else provide her with `Schrödinger's cat is alive`.

*Credit* : [Trolley problem - Schrödinger variation](https://imgur.com/gallery/p0C4Q)

#### Quest Items

1. Schrödinger's cat is dead [-3]
2. Schrödinger's cat is alive [+3]


### Tom GRUNDY - `LVL.5` | Puntius Pilate

*Artefact* : Puns are a dark art, much like necromancy. Raising the dead will get you killed. Punning with a killer sense of humor will also get you killed, making it a grave mistake, even if you were dead serious. Puntius Pilate is the seven year running world champion of puns.

*Role* : The PROTAGONIST chose the wrong day to cross paths with you - as you were just about to throw it down in the finals of the "PUNCH OUT" CHAMPIONSHIP! Never mind - The PROTAGONIST will just have to stand in as a finalist sub before you talk to them about anything else.

The battle takes place over 5 rounds, and each contestant delivers one PUNch per round. As the challenger, the PROTAGONIST opens each round with a pun, and the reigning champion gets to respond. Each member of a three headed JURY votes who had the best PUN that round - punster with most votes after 5 rounds WINS!

If the PROTAGONIST wins, provide her with `Gift of the Gab`, else `Overhwhalemed`.

#### Quest Items

1. Overhwhalemed [-5]
2. Gift of the Gab [+5]


### Isak LADEGAARD - `LVL.5` | Shadowbroker

*Artefact* : The Shadow Broker is an enigmatic figure at the head of an expansive organization which trades in DARKNET information, always selling to the highest bidder. The Shadow Broker appears to be highly competent at its trade: all secrets that are bought and sold never allow one customer of the Broker to gain a significant advantage, forcing the customers to continue trading information to avoid becoming disadvantaged, allowing the Broker to remain in business.

*Role* : You don't know how you got here... but informants tell you that you are in the __aether__. Thankfully, your comms implant relies on quantum entangled encryption so you still have access to the DARKNET in general ... and your organisation in particular.

THE PROTAGONIST will be able to come to you throughout the game and ask you what you have on offer - it's recommended to text her when new offers 'unlock' or otherwise make it clear that you have a new item for her - for example by wearing a fluorlink. 

The OFFERS all cost the PROTAGONIST points from her EVIDENCE SCORE, whereas the CONTRACT allows her to win one of your QUEST ITEMS.

#### OFFER 1 : BULLET POINTS

AVAILABILITY : From the beginning
DESC : When researching your own disappearance into the aether, you discovered that the same thing happened to the finalist of the punch out championship. If he is also there in the aether, you are confident that to get on his good side, the PROTAGONIST will need puns... so your intelligence agents have retrieved the prep notes from the other finalists... and you suggest the PROTAGONIST acquire them from you.
COST : 1 point
INFO : TEXT these to the PROTAGONIST... said your informants reported they would come in handy:

    - The cheese shop exploded as soon as you entered..., no trace of you BOY, ALL THAT LEFT WAS DEBRIE!
    - Light travels faster than sound. That's why BOY appears bright till you hear 'm speak!
    - WHAT?! Boy's trying to moon-ipulate me? This is my space party?! I PLANET! 
    - Unlike a white board, you're just a white BOY that's __unremarkable__!
    - BOY! You're like a bad Braille story. People don't even need to read you, they can just feel you!
    - Ain't these the Finals? Then why I'm playing a potato needin' glasses? Boy's a Spec-tater!

#### OFFER 2 : ANGEL OF DEATH

AVAILABILITY : After buying BULLET POINTS, or in ACT 2, whichever comes first.
DESC : Sometimes 
REWARD : Provide `Discovered Arrack` if contract is accepted, or `Interference` if it is rejected.

If bits and bytes can't reach the objective, you aren't shy of pushing atoms. Of course, being the SHADOW BROKER you use currency instead of putting yourself in harm's way - so you have an opportunity for the PROTAGONIST that would move the needle just a little bit towards being good.

One of your youngest recruits has let slip that his father is very ill. The doctors believe that the father has a week to live at most. He also explained that his father has a substantial life insurance policy that expires at midnight.

If his father dies before midnight, this young man will receive a very large sum of money. He says that the money would mean a great deal to him and his family, and that no good will come from his father’s living a few more days. You have used your network to confirm that indeed, your recruit is in desperate need of the money to raise his family of six. The contract is for the protagonist to plant a small networked device in the hospital... which would cause the equipment keeping him alive to malfunction. Is the PROTAGONIST interested? The Shadow Broker is sure to make it worth her while...

#### OFFER 3 : THE PHAROSI MATRIX

AVAILABILITY : After the PROTAGONIST engages CLAUDIO (Solution to the Fermi Paradox), and if she does not manage to solve it herself.
DESC : It has come to your attention that humanity is on the cusp of first contact. You'd prefer to keep this information to yourself, but you could give the protagonist a head start. Is the PROTAGONIST interested?
COST : 1 point
INFO : The solution is best attempted by drawing a matrix, with all the SECTORS as columns and the variables as rows (i.e. Species, Climate, Government, Agenda, Engine).

#### OFFER 4 : CONTAINMENT

AVAILABILITY : After the PROTAGONIST engages KAREN (Prehistoric Virus), and if she does not manage to resolve it herself.
DESC : It has come to your attention that a Prehistoric Virus might leak into the atmosphere unleashing a global pandemic... not that you care as you're based off-world ... but you've received intelligence that would prove vital to purging the virus before it leaks out. Is the PROTAGONIST interested?
COST : 1 point
INFO : The trick is to visit the first room twice - as that's the only room that hasn't been contaminated yet

#### OFFER 5 : THE PHAROSI QUARTER

AVAILABILITY : During ACT 2, and if she has bought offer 3 (Pharosi Matrix) and has not solved it herself. 
DESC : You've discovered the location of the Pharosi for youself... good this opens up great new frontiers for you...so as a thank you, you're willing to sell the PROTAGONIST coordinates to... narrow her search. Is the PROTAGONIST interested?
COST : 3 points
INFO : Informants report that:
  * The civilisation in SECTOR A uses JUMP DRIVES

### Claudio CANZONETTA - `LVL.5` | Solution to the Fermi Paradox

*Artefact* : The Fermi paradox is the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial civilizations and various high estimates for their probability. But this isn't the paradox... this is its solution.

The truth is, that aliens are broadcasting. But we don't know how to listen.
Aliens just aren't broadcasting with radio waves on the frequencies SETI is currently monitoring. They instead use neutrinos and lasers to communicate across the galaxy in a kind of “galactic” internet. Moreover, they use complex compression algorithms that humans don’t understand, gamma ray bursts humans can’t detect, and modulation methods that haven’t been discovered yet on Earth — the list goes on and on. But the word is out there, so keep listening!

As Carl Sagan rightfully speculated in 1985, aliens are also communicating at vastly different rates than is expected from the human experience - i.e. rates so slow or fast that humans don’t even recognize their efforts. As when alien civilizations take years to broadcast a single sentence, humans just haven't noticed that they are being contacted.

Aliens are often also much more advanced - so are communicating with _Matrioshka_ brains, or even more advanced technologies that humans can’t imagine and may never discover. Humans have been searching for signals from extraterrestrial life for less than 100 years, using techniques that some aliens have abandoned millions of years ago, or perhaps had skipped all together. Simply put: the chance that Earth's method of communication aligns perfectly with an alien civilization’s method is extremely slim indeed.

*Role* : As the SOLUTION TO THE FERMI PARADOX, you not only know why humans haven't heard from their alien counterparts... you also know where to find them.

But due to your paradoxical nature... even though you really, really want to help the PROTAGONIST, you won't help her find them, until she finds them herself, which isn't really helping at all, see! 

Yet, therein lies the opening! Present the PROTAGONIST with the following hints that will aid them in discovering not just any alien planet ... but the home world of the Pharosi!

The Pharosi are a really important ally to have, as they have the power to stand up to the COURT OF GALACTIC OPINION. If the PROTAGONIST were to discover their location - on her own - nothing would prevent you from informating the PHAROSI that the COURT OF GALACTIC OPINION is commiting a PRIME DIRECTIVE violation against Humanity. You expect that once the Pharosi hear of this,
a wormhole will open just beyond LUNA and the PHAROSI FLEET will come pouring through to Humanity's defence!

*Background*:  The Pharosi were the power brokers in Sherin's previous birthday party. They started out as an archivist order, collecting knowledge before it was lost to a galaxy at war. As they grew into an authority on the arcane matters of import, they evolved into an intelligence network, brokering intel and knowledge. Once their contemporaries came to rely on them, the Pharosi made an audacious gambit : To rid the galaxy of the very reason which had called for their exisitence. To eliminate the factions of war, and surpass the duality of good and evil. The Pharosi will not stand by while the Court of Galactic Opinion annihiliates a civilisation.

### Daisy TAM - `LVL.5` | Cabinet of Festivities

*Artefact* : The Cabinet of Festivities is the fourth branch of government.

*Role* : Upon encountering the PROTAGONIST, the CABINET OF FESTIVITIES makes the case for the Humanity salvation based on Humans being the only species with an undying capacity for sillyness. 

Humans are in fact much like Nimbus, endearingly stupid! And worth keeping around despite their flaws and vagaries. Take for example their infatuation with rotten foods! They even built an entire industry around it! 

To demonstrate how silly humans can be, the PROTAGONIST is invited to participate in a "blind tasting" of cheeses - Humans will celebrate the most trivial of differences, obsess over culture, tastes, and expression. Do we even need so many cheeses?!

The cheeses introduced to the PROTAGONIST are

* Cumin Cheese
* Old Cheese
* Lavender Cheese
* Goat Cheese
* Sheep Cheese

The PROTAGONIST is told up front which cheeses she will be tasting, and samples them one at a time, making a provisional judgement on the type of cheese after each sample. After having sampled all the cheeses, she can revisit any cheese as often as she likes. Once she has commited to her answer, all 5 names are then submitted and evaluated together. If the PROTAGONIST correctly guesses all five cheeses, provide `Parkinson's law of triviality`, else `American Cheese`.

#### Quest Items

1. Parkinson's law of triviality [+7]
2. American Cheese [-7]

### Sotiris TSOURIS - `LVL.BOSS` | Titans of Industry

*Artefact* : Powerful 19th Century United States businessman and bankers, this term relate to any businessman or banker who used questionable business practices to become powerful and wealthy.

*Role* : You didn't become the Titans of Industry by handing out FREEBIES! If the PROTAGONIST wants your help to save HUMANITY?! They will have to make you a deal!

Play a trading game that's based on Koehandel.

#### Setup

Each player receives

*COIN*

5 pieces worth 1 unit
4 pieces worth 3 units
3 pieces worth 5 units
3 pieces worth 0 units (to bluff)

*CARDS*

The cards consist of all 4 suits of playing cards with face value of 10,8,6,4,2 - each number represents a set of 4 suits. Suits carry no meaning. One player receives

```
card, pcs
 10 x 1
  8 x 3
  6 x 2
  4 x 3
  2 x 1
```

The other player receives the remaining cards.

#### Play

In turn, players make blind bids by:

1. Identifying which card they are offering to buy. This card must be of a set of which they have at least ONE card.
2. Hold out the amount they are willing to bid, concealed in a fist.
3. The other player then decides whether
    * to accept the bid, and takes the money, but then transfers the card to the other player, or
    * to blind counter bid in the same fashion for the same type of card(s) in that set from the offering player. In this case, both players reveal how much they bid in their fists, and the HIGHEST bid wins the card. The money is ALSO exchanged. I.e. both players lose what they bid - even the losing bid!  
3. Special rules - If a player has exactly two cards in a set, the bid is for BOTH cards in the set, i.e. not a single one.

Game ends when all quartets are complete. Each set is worth the face value on the card, i.e. the set of 10s if worth 10, not 40. The coins also count for their value. The player with the highest value of sets + coins wins.

If the PROTAGONIST wins, provide her with `Bill Gates`, if she loses `The Sackler Family`


#### Quest Items

1. Bill Gates [+10]
2. The Sackler Family [-10]


### Anna CUMMINS - `LVL.BOSS` | Gale of Creative Destruction

*Artefact* : The incessant product and process innovation
mechanism by which new production units replace outdated ones. This
restructuring process permeates major aspects of macroeconomic performance,
not only long-run growth but also economic fluctuations, structural adjustment
and the functioning of factor markets. Over the long run, the process of creative destruction accounts for over 50 per cent of productivity growth. 

*Role* : Argue that Humanity can't be destroyed by an outside force, as the rich would just crawl out of their bunkers with everyone else being dead and that would be the only legacy Humanity would have. [elaborate wildly]

You are not convinced that the PROTAGONIST is aligned with your philosophy that HUMANITY needs to be burnt to the ground in order for it to re-emerge in a batter form. That's why you'll put her to the test by challenging her to a game of ZERTZ! A game where through actions of the players, the board gets consistently smaller.

I'll prepare a setup where X seems like they are sure to win, but Y in fact has a way to guarantee a win. The PROTAGONIST will be allowed to pick a side to play on. You then play until you find a winner.

If the Protagonist defeats you, provide her with `Non-Symmetric Awe`, because it's clear that the drive in the PROTAGONIST to win and persist is STRONG - this does sit well with being destroyed. If you defeat the Protagonist, provide `Tabula Rasa` YESS YESSS!! To a blank slate everything shall be returned!


#### Quest Items

1. Non-Symmetric Awe [+8]
2. Tabula Rasa [-8]

### Benjamin HALL - `LVL.BOSS` | Synthetic Synthesis

*Artefact* : The Synthetic Synthesis test is an examination designed to measure any emotional deviance by synths. To be "off baseline" would be considered a failure of such test.

*Role* : Deliver the Synthetic Synthesis to the PROTAGONIST with the following baseline text 

```
a comfy, couple of cats come to purr 

their fur is soft and warm, these cats

their names are in your mind, say them aloud

a cloud passes over, fluffy and gentle

something seemingly Cumulous, Cumulo- what? 

is it nice to nestle with these gentle cats

do you long to snuggle with these gentle cats?

when they play how does it feel, gentle cats?

what does it feel like to hold these cats that you hold in your heart? 

Do they teach you how to love them when their tails are interlinked?

Does your heart fill with joy when the cats surround you? Interlinked.

Do you simply love two of them or all of them? Interlinked

Millions and billions of them - all cats interlinked.

Cats within cats. Interlinked.

Which do you love the most, Nimbus or Phaera?
```

Upon receiving inconsistent results, challenge the PROTAGONIST to one of her favourite video games. If she wins that challenge, provide `Positive Sum Games` else `Zero Sum Games`

#### Quest Items

1. Positive Sum Games [+10]
2. Zero Sum Gamess [-10]
