LOC : Flat 13B, 208-214 Fa Yuen Street, Prince Edward

Specials:

Sherin is permitting me to sprinkle a little extra on the night (yaay!) - on the sole condition that I don't force anyone's participation (shucks :(). So I'm weaving a very light narrative thread through-out the night where Sherin will be collecting quest items from each of us. The items can then be combined at the end of the night to determine the fate of all humanity! Yes. It's a real life video game where Sherin is the protagonist and we the NPCs!
    
So you can opt for 1 of 7 levels of participation - please let me know what you'd up for!

MIN - lvl.snackbear - Opt-out from the game, just enjoy the snacks!
-1- Give Sherin a quest item when she asks for it.
-2- The above, and challenge Sherin to a word game (e.g. 20 Questions)
-3- The above, and play a flavour character (your character will want to convince Sherin of something)
-4- The above, and challenge Sherin to a card game (e.g. one-round of Dixit)
-5- The above, and play a minor character (your character will have a story to tell)
MAX - lvl.bosslord - Be a boss, and challenge Sherin to a mini boardgame (5 minutes)

All items and games will be prepared, and you'll be briefed in advanced. Games are simplified versions of games, so it'll just take 2 minutes to understand how to play them.
